          If you're looking for a place where you can step off the grid without truly leaving civilization behind, Fire Island National Seashore is it. Just a short ferry ride from Long Island, this stretch of protected Atlantic coastline gave me the quiet escape I didn’t know I needed. No cars, no city noise—just sand dunes, salt air, and the sound of waves washing away stress.

I caught the ferry from Bay Shore on a Friday afternoon, backpack slung over my shoulder, sneakers already full of sand. The ride across the Great South Bay took just under 30 minutes, and as we neared the shore, I could already feel myself starting to unwind. Fire Island has this way of slowing everything down the second you set foot on it.

My first stop was Watch Hill, one of the main access points to the national seashore. It's got a small marina, a general store, and campsites nestled just steps from the beach. I’d reserved a tent site for the weekend, and let me tell you—waking up to the sound of birds and falling asleep to crashing waves is hard to beat.

From Watch Hill, I explored the Otis Pike Fire Island High Dune Wilderness, the only federally designated wilderness area in New York State. Hiking the trails here felt like wandering through a living postcard. Sea grasses swayed in the breeze, and ospreys circled overhead. It’s raw, it’s wild, and it made me forget my phone even existed (except when I used it to take way too many pictures).

Evenings on Fire Island are pure magic. I watched the sun set over the bay, painting the sky with cotton-candy pinks and fiery oranges. Later, I lay out on the beach and stared up at the stars. With no light pollution to get in the way, the night sky felt impossibly vast and bright. I even spotted the Milky Way for the first time in years.

Before heading home, I made a stop at the Fire Island Lighthouse, located at the western end of the seashore. Climbing the 182 steps to the top was totally worth it for the panoramic views. From up there, you can see the Manhattan skyline faintly on the horizon—reminding you how close (and yet how far away) the city really is.
